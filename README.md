# Tutorial-Time-series-exploration-Crypto-Price
I wanted to see a notebook / tutorial that would take me through the basics of working with time series.  Most notebooks I found were not very rigorous. So I wrote my own. This is: 1. a good starting point for understanding time series data and how it differs from problems with other type of tabular data  2. a cookbook to be used for exploration when starting to work with a new dataset
